    <h1 style="color: black; font-size:larger border 2pt;">Introduction</h1>
    <p>My first week at AkiraChix was awesome. I had an opportunity to create meaningful relationship with my fellow peers. 
        My learning experience was amazing, the trainig assistance were very instrumental in helping me operate my laptop.
        I had an opportunity to get a mentor who will help me during my stay in the program. I enjoy the variety of food we are served.
        We rest on weekends and also have an opportunity to clean the organization.

    <p> The trainers are very proactive and enjoy what they do,they assit us by answering all our questions hence give us clarity.
        I am greatful that we will have an opportunity to present our slides in the coming week. This will really help us improve
        on our self confidence. Looking foward to have a happy stay for the next eight months.
